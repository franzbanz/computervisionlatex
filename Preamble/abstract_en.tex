{\LARGE Visualization Verification of Complex Avionic Models Using Computer Vision}

With the growing complexity of models and applications in aviation, use of domain specific modeling (DSM) in the field has become vital. It enables engineers to work more efficiently and, through automatic code generation, significantly reduces the number of errors in the resulting programs. For use in safety-critical applications however, DSM requires significant effort. One important issue is ensuring correct model visualization to reduce the amount of manual verification work.\\
This paper aims to build upon \cite{og_paper} to improve the reliability of the automated verification of block-diagram visualizations in DSM. In \cite{og_paper}, a computer vision library called "Open Computer Vision" (OpenCV) is used to recognize and process block diagram models. the recognized Data is compared with the original model to find and indicate deviations to the user inside a browser-based graphical model editor called "eXtensible Graphical EMOF Editor" or "XGEE".\\
This paper extends the capabilities of the block diagram recognition algorithm to work with complex and diverse diagrams in three graphical domain-specific languages within XGEE. The new implementation is able to correctly identify and process intersecting or partially obscured lines in any orientation, detect a larger variety of vertices and process text labels in multiple orientations, showcasing its potential to significantly reduce manual verification effort in DSM applications.
