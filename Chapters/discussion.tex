\chapter{Discussion}

\section{Limitations of current Methods}
Outline specific scenarios where the current methods may fail or produce suboptimal results (e.g., scaling issues, overlapping elements).
\section{Enhancing Integration with XGEE's featueres}
Discuss ways to better align the implemented methods with XGEEâ€™s existing or future features (e.g., better user guidance, advanced arrangement algorithms).
\section{Expanding to other Domains or Applications}
Explore how these methods could be adapted for other domains or tools with similar challenges.
